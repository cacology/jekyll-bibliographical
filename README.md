# jekyll-bibliographical An effort to develop a bibliographical
toolkit that enables checklists, catalogs, and bibliographies along
the lines of Bowers and Tanselle

## Plan

A set of xml schemas and scripts are in development as
[Bibliographical XML](https://github.com/cacology/bibliographicalXML)
(perhaps still private at this point, but not for long). These schemas
and scripts help take the approach to bibliographical information
outlined by Fredson Bowers and enhanced by G.T. Tanselle and adapt
them for usage in xml. However, these schema and tools do not attempt
to create a useful tool, just make a toolkit for other practical
applications.

This is intended as a practical application.

Jekyll is a standard approach to creating web spaces and allows a
great deal of flexibility and adjustment to work with different
approaches. This project is merely to:

1. Incorperate the xml schema and styling scripts into a Jekyll
   workflow
2. Provide some examples of records using this workflow

as a proof-of-concept, for now. This project runs parallel to an
all-xml approach developed by David Levy
[bibliographicalXML-client](https://github.com/dmlpublic/bibliographicalXML-client)
and both have been developed in close conversation.
